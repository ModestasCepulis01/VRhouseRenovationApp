# VRhouseRenovationApp
A photogrammetry and virtual reality based Unity application.

Abstract:
-------------------------------------------

The objective was to create and use detailed 3D objects based on real-life references.
This was accomplished by using a smart phone-based camera lens and a consumer based mobile phone app that 
would allow to process pictures and video data for the creation of a 3D object. 

Multiple 3D objects were scanned using a photogrammetry based mobile application (Trnio). 
The 3D objects were imported into an object editing software (Blender), refactored as needed and 
imported into a 3D space created in the Unity engine. 
 
An additional room building feature was added with the capabilities of creating customizable floor and wall objects. 
 
The VR system was developed using Unity game engine and its virtual reality components. 
The system was implemented on a ‘Oculus Rift S’ virtual reality headset and two controllers.
