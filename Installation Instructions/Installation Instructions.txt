For testing, these specific applications or physical items need to be used:

Virtual reality headset:

Oculus Rift S

Game engine that was used to run the application:

Unity, version 2020.1.9f1
(This specific version needs to be used when running the application of
 the application will not work/ may not work properly).

Once these items/applications are installed,
the virtual reality headset needs to be connected and,
the application folder needs to be opened through Unity game engine.

From then, the scene called 'MainMenu' 
(that can be found in the 'Scenes' Folder in Assets)
needs to be run.

Thanks.
